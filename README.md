# Godot-Rust-SMB-clone
A simple Super Mario Bros clone (only level 1-1) made in Godot using Rust

Made using the Rust bindings for Godot: https://godot-rust.github.io/

## Compiling

To build the game you need both the Godot editor and the cargo Rust environment.

To compile the Rust portion you run build.py:
```
python3 build.py [all | windows | linux] (There is no Mac option atm.)
```

Then use the godot editor to export the project to your desired project.
